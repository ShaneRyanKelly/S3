This is a simple compiler written in C designed to support a number of functions
 and operations. This compiler compiles to a 16-bit assembly language for a simple
 register-oriented architecture. The compiler may be compiled from the s3.c source
 code found in this directory. S3.s is the input file for the compiler which
 includes calls to the following i/o functions:

println
print
readint

furthermore, this compiler includes support for single-lined comments, compound
 statements, nested brackets, unary plus/minus operations, addition, subtraction,
 multiplication, and division.

The output file, S3.a is included to demonstrate the compiler's capabilities and
 output.
